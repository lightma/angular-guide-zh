## What are Angular Services?什么是ng服务？

服务是单实例对象或者函数，用来实现web应用里常见的特定任务。
ng有很多内置的服务，比如[$http service服务](http://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng.$http)，它提供了对浏览器`XMLHttpRequest`对象的访问，用以实现向服务器发出请求。
就像其他ng核心的变量和标识符一样，内置的服务名都以`$`开头(比如上面提到的`$http`)。当然，你也能创建自定义的服务。
Angular services are singletons objects or functions that carry out specific tasks common to web apps.
Angular has a number of built in services, such as the {@link api/ng.$http $http service}, which
provides access to the browser's `XMLHttpRequest` object for making requests to a server. Like other core
Angular variables and identifiers, the built-in services always start with `$` (such as `$http` mentioned
above). You can also create your own custom services.

## 使用服务

为了使用某个服务，你需要指定其他组件(例如控制器，其他服务，过滤器或指令)依赖于该服务，剩下的就交给ng的依赖注入子系统吧。ng依赖注入子系统负责服务实例化、依赖解析并按声明向组件提供依赖。
To use an Angular service, you identify it as a dependency for the component (controller, service,
filter or directive) that depends on the service.  Angular's dependency injection subsystem takes
care of the rest. The Angular injector subsystem is in charge of service instantiation, resolution
of dependencies, and provision of dependencies to components as requested.

ng的依赖注入使用["构造器注入"](http://misko.hevery.com/2009/02/19/constructor-injection-vs-setter-injection/)。Angular injects dependencies using
{@link http://misko.hevery.com/2009/02/19/constructor-injection-vs-setter-injection/ "constructor" injection}.
The dependency is passed to the component's factory/constructor function. Because JavaScript is a dynamically
typed language, Angular's dependency injection subsystem cannot use static types to identify service
dependencies. For this reason a component must, explicitly, define its dependencies by using one of the
{@link di injection annotation} methods.  For example, by providing a `$inject` property:

        var MyController = function($location) { ... };
        MyController.$inject = ['$location'];
        myModule.controller('MyController', MyController);

Or by providing an "inline" injection annotation:

        var myService = function($http) { ... };
        myModule.factory('myService', ['$http', myService]);

## Defining a Service

Application developers are free to define their own services by registering their name, and **service
factory function**, in Angular modules.

The purpose of the **service factory function** is to generate the single object, or function, that 
represents the service to the rest of the application. That object, or function, will then be
injected into any component (controller, service, filter or directive) that specifies a dependency
on the service.

Angular factory functions are executed lazily. That is, they are only executed when needed 
to satisfy a dependency, and are then executed exactly once for each service. Everything that is
dependent on this service gets a reference to the single instance generated by the service factory.
